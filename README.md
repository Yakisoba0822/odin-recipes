# odin-recipes
This is my first attempt at using everything I have learned so far from the 
foundations of HTML. I will be creating a website with three recipes. Each recipe will be hyperlinked leading to a diffent page where the entire recipe is found. I tried my best to make an okay website and I really hope you do enjoy trying these recipes for yourself.
