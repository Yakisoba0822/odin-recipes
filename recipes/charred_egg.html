  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I bring to you Bennett's signature dish, the amazing Teyvat Charred Egg! 
        This is an amazing fried egg that is said to bring you great misfortune as well
        as a good source of protein. The egg yolk will be nice and runny while the bottom
        with have a nice charred crunchy texture.
        After eating this you will definitely give a thumbs up!
